<p>The fundemental point of the second chapter of The Picture of Dorian Gray is that Power, Identity, and Individuality
form a Trifecta of personal traits that, complementing each other, give people a leg up in society. There are several
incidents in the second chapter in both positive and negative cases. Lord Henry, who makes controversial claims,
achieves a unique identity by these radical proclamations as a very "alt" person. This "Uniqueness" give him power, in
the form of attention (Everyone pays attention to what he has to say) and influence over thoese more inexperienced,
like Dorian Gray. Dorian, in fact, is a prime example of the opposite holding true also. Before meeting Henry, he has
little unique about him (other than, possibly, playing music and being pretty), which leads to no sense of
individuality. </p>
